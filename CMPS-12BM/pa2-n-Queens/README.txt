This was the second programming assignment in the class. We were expected to extend the 8 Queens mathematical problem to any number (n) of queens. Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

I used a two-dimensional array to simulate the chess board, and incremented the paths that the queens could take, to find out which spaces could be occupied later.
