Overall, out of everything we did in CMPS 12B/M, I think this assignment was the most difficult. I used a Queue ADT to simulate lines at a grocery store, to find the optimal amount of open cashier lanes to process incoming shoppers (the Job class). Multiple iterations with different amounts of cashiers (from 1 to n, where n was the amount of shoppers) were needed, with possible edge cases (e.g. two shoppers arriving at the same time, one shopper finishing as another shopper arrives).
