# UCSC-Classes
Any code that I can find, from the classes I took at UCSC.

Quarter 1: CMPS 5J
Quarter 2: CMPS 12A/L
Quarter 3: CMPS 12B/M

There were really only two assignments I considered thought-provoking (n-Queens and Simulation), and they were from CMPS 12B/M. Some of my code for CMPS 12A/L has been lost, as I wrote it in ZyLabs and didn't save it before the end of the quarter.
